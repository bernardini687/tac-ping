I will always love this view.
No matter what's changing, this openness fills my eyes everytime.
Water's falling from above, yet here I am, dry as a kibble.
Humans, on the other hand, they always seem on the hunt.
Maybe one day I'll have to get myself wet, too.
For now, The Caretaker fills my bowl every single day.
Look at them.
Smaller than my paw, from this height.
So inelegant.
Why do you like them so much, Ping?

I'm here because of them.

Where would you be if it wasn't for humans?

I wouldn't be.

...
Am I also here because of them?

It's more complicated with you, Tac.
In a way, you're here because of Emily.

I once thought The Caretaker was my mama, then I learned she should be called a "human" and I should be called a "cat", therefore she couldn't be my mama.

How did you learned so much?

Through the power of observation, obviously.
Plus, I'm an egregious listener.

Is the world you see through this window all that you observe and listen to?

Well, I also examine the flat worlds in The Caretaker's screens.
Sometimes many sounds come out of those too.

I simply mean to observe.

Sometimes direct questions are more efficient.

There's a pending question, Tac.

What's that?

"Do you enjoy spending your time like that?"

Do I enjoy washing my genitals?

"Well, I also examine the flat worlds in The Caretaker's screens.
Sometimes many sounds come out of those too.
I don't understand everything but I recognize various things that repeat over and over."
That's what you said.
And then I asked you "Do you enjoy spending your time like that?"

Whoa, that's a sharp memory!
