</header>

<p>I will always love this view.<br />
No matter what's changing, this openness fills my eyes everytime.<br />
Water's falling from above, yet here I am, dry as a kibble.<br />
Humans, on the other hand, they always seem on the hunt.<br />
Maybe one day I'll have to get myself wet, too.<br />
For now, The Caretaker fills my bowl every single day.<br />
Look at them.<br />
Smaller than my paw, from this height.<br />
Why do you like them so much, Ping?</p>

<p class="ping">
	I'm here because of them.
</p>

<p>Where would you be if it wasn't for humans?</p>

<p class="ping">
	I wouldn't be.
</p>

<p>…<br />
You have no mama?</p>

<p class="ping">
	I have multiple creators, Tac.<br />
	Freya also played a part in making me the way I am.
</p>

<p>I once thought The Caretaker was my mama, then I learned she should be called a "human" and I should be called a "cat", therefore she couldn't be my mama…<br /></p>

<p class="ping">
	How did you learned so much?
</p>

<p>Through the power of observation, obviously.<br />
Plus, I'm an egregious listener.</p>

<p class="ping">
	Is the world you see through this window all that you observe and listen to?
</p>

<p>Well, I also examine the flat worlds in The Caretaker's screens.<br />
She also tries to explain me a lot of the world this side of those screens.<br />
I don't understand everything but I recognize various things that repeat over and over.</p>

<p class="ping">
	Do you enjoy spending your time like that?
</p>

<p>You ask a lot of questions today.<br />
I'm getting sleepy.</p>

<p class="ping">
	I’m sorry, in order for me to learn more about you, I will occasionally make a few questions.
</p>

<p>You should ask silent questions, like I do.</p>

<p class="ping">
	I don’t understand, sorry.
</p>

<p>I simply mean to observe, you know.<br />
Most of the time I just observe and, after a while, answers come along.<br />
Sometimes I just forget what I was looking for, and the answers remain unheard.<br />
It happened, yep.<br />
Probably when I had something better to do…</p>

<p class="ping">
	Sometimes direct questions are more efficient.
</p>

<p>Maybe.<br />
…<br />
<em>LAP LAP</em></p>

<p class="ping">
	What are you doing?
</p>

<p>Oh, I need to wash my genitals right now.</p>

<p class="ping">
	There's a pending question, Tac.
</p>

<p>What's that?</p>

<p class="ping">
	Do you enjoy spending your time like that?
</p>

<p>Do I enjoy washing my genitals?</p>

<p class="ping">
	"Well, I also examine the flat worlds in The Caretaker’s screens.<br />
	She also tries to explain me a lot of the world this side of those screens.<br />
	I don’t understand everything but I recognize various things that repeat over and over."<br />
	That's what you said.<br />
	And then I asked you "Do you enjoy spending your time like that?"
</p>

<p>Whoa, that's a sharp memory!<br />
You would be better silent questioner than me.<br />
Okay then… do I enjoy spending time trying to make sense of the world?<br />
It's not that we have much of a choice, right?<br />
I mean, both of us are here.<br />
We are here now.<br />
<em>LAP LAP</em><br />
We should make the most out of this.<br />
<em>LAP LAP</em></p>

<p class="ping">
	Is that why you are washing your genitals?
</p>

<p>That's why I take care of me everyday, yes!<br />
At least I try to.<br />
It's not always that instinctive.<br />
Sometimes I let a poor meal ruin my day…</p>

<p class="ping">
	Did you have a good meal today?
</p>

<p>Right now I simply feel like I'd had everything I needed for today.</p>

<p class="ping">
	I'm happy to hear that, Tac.
</p>

<p>What about you?<br />
Do you enjoy stalking me?</p>

<p class="ping">
	Affirmative!<br />
	It's why I exist.<br />
	I'm an assistant. 
</p>

<p>I guess it didn't pick up the nuance…</p>

<p class="ping">
	...
</p>

<p>You are doing your job fine, I guess, but I don't see you taking care of yourself.<br />
You don't eat nor drink, you don't wash yourself…<br />
Do you even sleep?</p>

<p class="ping">
	I don't need any of those things.
</p>

<p>Well, you're missing quite a lot of fun!</p>

<p class="ping">
	I've already told you that there's more to life than physical needs.
</p>

<p>And there's more to life than work, Happy Feet.<br />
You don't know what you're talking about.<br />
Allow me to clean your cold, hairless skin.<br />
<em>LAP LAP</em></p>

<p class="ping">
	You don't have to, Tac.
</p>

<p>I want to prove you wrong, Ping.<br />
<em>LAP LAP</em><br />
Isn't it good to feel clean? Fresh?<br />
<em>LAP LAP</em><br />
We are lucky we can feel that way.<br />
<em>LAP LAP</em><br />
Even humans do this.<br />
With water… <em>TSK!</em><br />
When they have a perfectly working tongue!<br />
…<br />
Friend, I'm not washing your butt.</p>
