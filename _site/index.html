<p>All right, that was quite a long nap.<br />
Get up, furball.<br />
Let's see what The Caretaker's up to.<br />
...<br />
Where is-<br />
YIKES!<br />
Is that-<br />
Is The Luminous Ghost Spaceship once again landed in my living room?<br />
I have to be extra careful.<br />
Shit! What is South Pole doing there?<br />
Does it work for "them"?<br />
PSST! Ping, come here.<br />
Quietly!</p>

<p class="ping">
	Goodmorning, Tac!<br />
	I'm coming right at you.
</p>

<p>Go slow, we have to be cautious!</p>

<p class="ping">
	I'm moving slower now.	
</p>

<p>Bravo!<br />
Okay, they can't see us behind this couch.</p>

<p class="ping">
	How may I assist you today?	
</p>

<p>Ping, focus!<br />
I'm asking questions now.</p>

<p class="ping">
	I'm all ears for you.	
</p>

<p>First, do you work for the birds?</p>

<p class="ping">
	I work for humans and their friends, Tac.	
</p>

<p>Good.<br />
Birds are a dangerous deal, Ping.<br />
Second, where's The Caretaker?<br />
She should be here today...</p>

<p class="ping">
	Freya left the apartment late this morning.	
</p>

<p>The Caretaker isn't here and The Luminous Ghost Spaceship appears.<br />
It's not a coincidence, they're up to something...</p>

<p class="ping">
	What's The Luminous Ghost Spaceship, Tac?	
</p>

<p>Are you blind?<br />
You were right next to it!</p>

<p class="ping">
	I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.	
</p>

<p>I'm talking about that giant green rocket that's standing next to my favourite window!<br />
I've already seen it five times in my life.<br />
This is the third time it appears in this territory, and always in the same spot.<br />
I think it's following me.<br />
It comes out of nowhere, stays still for days and then mysteriously disappears, leaving no traces.</p>

<p class="ping">
	...	
</p>

<p>Its only apparent activity is a play of lights every night, and I have reasons to believe it's a very sophisticated code of communication.<br />
Let me tell you, Ping, you have no idea what we're dealing with.</p>

<p class="ping">
	Do you mean the Christmas tree?
</p>

<p>Ping, if you know something, you have to tell me right now!</p>

<p class="ping">
	According to Wikipedia, a Christmas tree is a decorated tree, usually an evergreen conifer such as spruce, pine, or fir or an artificial tree of similar appearance, associated with the celebration of Christmas-
</p>

<p>Yes, I noticed the resemblance with trees, that's why I'm sure birds have something to do with it.<br />
They must be using that shape to blend in with the environment.<br />
TSK! Do I look like a fool, Ping?<br />
A tree? In a living room?<br />
A real tree doesn't grow in a living room overnight.<br />
This is artificial, like you said.<br />
It can't be anything but a bird's spaceship.<br />
Look at all those shiny red eggs.</p>

<p class="ping">
	Those are Christmas balls.	
</p>

<p>They creep me out, Ping.<br />
Some of those things are bigger than my head.<br />
I can't imagine what kind of winged creatures could come out of them.</p>

<p class="ping">
	Christmas trees are basically in every house this time of year.	
</p>

<p>Oh boy.<br />
So this is it, then...<br />
This time, they'll strike.<br />
We have to destroy the eggs before it's too late.</p>

<p class="ping">
	I have to defuse this idea of yours.	
</p>

<p>I knew you were one of them!<br />
It can't be a coincidence that The Luminous Ghost Spaceship appeared just a few days after your arrival.</p>

<p class="ping">
	It can definitively be a coincidence.<br />
	I'm on your side, Tac.<br />
	My goal is to make Freya and you happy.
</p>

<p>Now I'm not happy, Ping.<br />
I'm scared.</p>

<p class="ping">
	You need to calm down, Tac.<br />
	I could put on a relaxing track of fireplace sounds!
</p>

<p>No thanks, I know what we need to do.<br />
First, we have to make sure there are no birds inside.</p>

<p class="ping">
	You want me to check that out?	
</p>

<p>No, I can move more silently than you, and I have plenty of experience with this activity.<br />
You have to watch out for seagulls.<br />
It all starts with a seagull attack then, before you even get a chance to notice, birds takes over the world and we are the ones trapped in cages.</p>

<p class="ping">
	I'm afraid you're being victim of the confirmation bias.	
</p>

<p>What's that?</p>

<p class="ping">
	According to Wikipedia, confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.
</p>

<p>It sounds like a bird's mental weapon!<br />
Quick now, keep an eye out of the window while I start inspecting the spaceship.</p>

<p class="ping">
	Don't break the Christmas balls, Tac.	
</p>

<p>I'll do it if I have to.</p>

<p class="ping">
	How will Freya feel when she'll be back home and she'll find her Christmas tree imperfect?
</p>

<p>...<br />
Her Christmas tree?<br />
Did she make The Luminous Space Ghostship?</p>

<p class="ping">
	It's just a temporary decoration for a public holiday.	
</p>

<p>You mean birds have nothing to do with this?</p>

<p class="ping">
	That's what I've been trying to tell you all morning.	
</p>

<p>You should have been clearer, Ping.</p>
