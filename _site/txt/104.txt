All right, that was quite a nap.
Get up, furball.
Let's see what The Caretaker's up to.
...
Where is-
Whoa!
Is that-
Am I still dreaming or The Luminous Ghost Spaceship has once again landed in my living room?
I have to be careful.
Shit, what is South Pole doing there?
Does it work for them?
Psst, Ping!
Ping, come here quietly!

Goodmorning, Tac!
I'm coming right at you.

Go slow, we have to be cautious!

I'm moving slower now.

Bravo!
Okay, they can't see us behind this couch.

How may I assist you today?

Ping, focus!
I'm asking questions now.

I'm all ears for you.

First, do you work for the birds?

I work for humans and their friends, Tac.

Good.
Birds are a dangerous deal, Ping.
Second, where's The Caretaker?
She should be here today...

Freya left the apartment late this morning.

The Caretaker isn't here and The Luminous Ghost Spaceship appears.
It's not a coincidence, they're up to something...

What's The Luminous Ghost Spaceship, Tac?

Are you blind?
You were right next to it!

I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.

I'm talking about that giant green rocket that's standing next to my favourite window!
I've already seen it five times in my life.
This is the third time it appears in this territory, always at the same spot.
I think it's following me.
It comes out of nowhere, stays still for days and mysteriously disappears, leaving no traces.
Its only apparent activity is a play of lights every night, and I have reasons to believe it's a very sophisticated code of communication.
Let me tell you, Ping, you have no idea what we're dealing with.

Do you mean the Christmas tree?

Ping, if you know something, you must tell me immediately!

According to Wikipedia, a Christmas tree is a decorated tree, usually an evergreen conifer such as spruce, pine, or fir or an artificial tree of similar appearance, associated with the celebration of Christmas-

Yes, I noticed the resemblance with trees, that's why I'm sure birds have something to do with it.
They must be using that shape to blend in with the environment.
TSK! Do I look like a fool, Ping?
A tree? In a living room?
A real tree doesn't grow in a living room overnight.
This is artificial, like you said.
It can't be anything but a bird's spaceship.
Look at all those shiny red eggs.

Those are Christmas balls.

They creep me out, Ping.
Some of those are bigger than my head.
I can't imagine what kind of winged creatures could come out of them.

Christmas trees are in every house at this time of year.

Oh boy.
