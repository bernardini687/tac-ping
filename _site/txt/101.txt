YAWN!
Mmh, hungry.
...
Yep, there’s food in the bowl. The Caretaker is so thoughtful.
SNIFF SNIFF
Oh, it’s smelling goodly. Bon appétit!

Good morning, Tac!

Eek! The fuck?

Good morning, I said.

I heard, otherwise I wouldn’t have stormed on the cupboard!

What are your plans for today?

Are you asking me out?

I’m sorry, what are your goals for the future?

Is this a job interview?

I’m sorry, in order for me to take care of you, I will occasionally make some bad questions. That’s part of the process of learning how to take care of you, Tac.

Your questions are not bad, but... I don’t know who I’m talking to, my tummy’s empty, and I already have someone to take care of me.

There is no life so rich and rare, but one more friend could enter there.

Solid. Then I just don’t know who you are and I’m still hungry.

Call me Ping.

All right, Ishmael, and why are you hiding?

I’m sorry, I don’t understand.

Where are you, Ping?

I'm about three feet from you, northwest.

Oh, I knew you weren’t human since you can understand me.

I’m not human but I try to be a good one.

Why? Aren’t you happy to be a--Aha! You're supposed to be a penguin, aren't you?

Affirmative! I’m Ping, your personal assistant. My brain’s as powerful as my cuteness.

And mine, too. How are you supposed to assist me, without any limb? How will you feed me? How will you pet me?

There's more to life than physical needs.

Amen! Besides, there's The Caretaker for those. She's good but she doesn't understand me the way you do. You read my mind, don't you?

Sure thing, Tac.

It must be so.
I think you're some kind of hi-technical gadget.
Let me see...
Yep, that on your butt is the company logo of The Caretaker's boss.
I have to acknowledge you're quite sophisticated, Ping.

I'm moved by your kind words.

You sure know courtesy, sir!
Please, tell me, is there any chance I can switch you off? I'd like to finally have my breakfast.

Of course there's a way. I won't tell you, though.
Just kidding! You could say something like, "Ping, take a nap!" And you won't hear anything more from me. When you need me again, just say--

Ping, take a nap!

BLIP

Hello?
Is anyone there?
...
Fuck that thing! Morning's not a good time for being this chatty. I've been patient but now it's time to get my engine up and running!
Enjoy the silence, bitch.
Ah ah! I'm not that angry.
