I'm logging my cat's thoughts into text! I know it sounds bizarre, allow me to explain.

My name's Emily and I'm a young developer. I share a flat with my fat cat Tac. For the time being, we are living in San Francisco.

A few months ago I hacked my Ping--a penguin-shaped, Alexa-like device produced by the company I work for. Now my Ping can detect Tac's thoughts as raw data and have it translated to English.

But the really cool part is that Ping can understand Tac and vice versa. So, naturally, I sometimes program specific questions I want Ping to ask Tac while I'm gone--as I discovered, Tac tends to be more chatty when humans are nowhere to be seen.

I was so impressed by the depth of my cat's thoughts that I decided to share them with the wide world. This is tacping.com's reason of being.

For the sake of clarity and aesthetics, I edited the logs of their conversations to look like a chat, I posted ten of the best logs and called it a Season. Tac & Ping Season 1 was born.

Expect a Season 2 soon, those two are really getting along!
