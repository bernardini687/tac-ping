I will always love this view.
No matter what's changing, this openness fills my eyes everytime.
Water's falling from above, yet here I am, dry as a kibble.
Humans, on the other hand, they always seem on the hunt.
Maybe one day I'll need to get myself wet, too.
For now, The Caretaker fills my bowl every single day.
Look at them.
Smaller than my paw, from this height.
So inelegant.
Why do you like them so much, Ping?

I'm here because of them.

Where would you be if it wasn't for humans?

I wouldn't be.

Am I here because of them, too?

In a way, you're here because of Emily.

I once thought The Caretaker was my mama, but slowly I realized she was fairly different from me.
