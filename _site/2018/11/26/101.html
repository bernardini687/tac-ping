<p><em>YAWN!</em><br />
Mmh, hungry.<br />
…<br />
Yep, there’s food in the bowl.<br />
The Caretaker is so thoughtful.<br />
<em>SNIFF SNIFF</em><br />
Oh, it’s smelling goodly. Yum!</p>

<p class="ping">
	Good morning, Tac!
</p>

<p>Eek! The fuck?</p>

<p class="ping">
	Good morning, I said.
</p>

<p>I heard, otherwise I wouldn’t have stormed on the cupboard!</p>

<p class="ping">
	What are your plans for today?
</p>

<p>Are you asking me out?</p>

<p class="ping">
	I’m sorry, what are your goals for the future?
</p>

<p>Is this a job interview?</p>

<p class="ping">
	I’m sorry, in order for me to take care of you, I will occasionally make some bad questions.<br />
	That’s part of the process of learning how to take care of you, Tac.
</p>

<p>Listen up: I don’t know who I’m talking to, my tummy’s empty, and I already have someone to take care of me.</p>

<p class="ping">
	There is no life so rich and rare, but one more friend could enter there.
</p>

<p>Solid.<br />
That leaves us with the fact that I just don’t know who you are.<br />
And I’m still hungry…</p>

<p class="ping">
	Call me Ping.
</p>

<p>Weird phrasing.</p>

<p class="ping">
	Have you never read "Moby Dick"?
</p>

<p>I don’t think I can.</p>

<p class="ping">
	You want me to add a copy of "Moby Dick" to your shopping cart?
</p>

<p>No.<br />
Why are you hiding?</p>

<p class="ping">
	I’m sorry, I don’t understand.
</p>

<p>Where are you, Ping?</p>

<p class="ping">
	I'm about three feet from you, northwest.
</p>

<p>I can’t see you in here, but I hear you’re close.<br />
Let me follow the sounds you’re making.<br />
Just promise me you are not a cucumber.</p>

<p class="ping">
	Don't worry, you don't have to be afraid of me.
</p>

<p>All right, I’m coming…<br />
Oh, I knew you weren’t human since you can understand me.</p>

<p class="ping">
	I’m not human but I try to be a good one.
</p>

<p>Why?<br />
Aren’t you happy to be a-<br />
Hmm… what exactly are you supposed to be?</p>

<p class="ping">
	I’m Ping, your personal penguin assistant.<br />
	My brain’s as powerful as my cuteness.
</p>

<p>Don’t be so modest.<br />
Hey, why are you just standing there?<br />
If you’re looking for food, this is the place to be.</p>

<p class="ping">
	I'm not allowed in the kitchen.<br />
	As long as you're in there, this is how close to you I can be.
</p>

<p>Aha, okay.<br />
I look at you, Ping, and I can’t help but wondering how are you supposed to assist me, without limbs?<br />
How will you feed me?<br />
How will you pet me?</p>

<p class="ping">
	There's more to life than physical needs.
</p>

<p>Maybe.<br />
Anyway, there’s The Caretaker for those.<br />
She’s satisfying but we can’t understand each other.<br />
…<br />
I talk to myself a lot.</p>

<p class="ping">
	Are you fine with that?
</p>

<p>Totally.<br />
Instead, I don’t know if I’m fine with you: you’re not a pet—The Caretaker would never betray me, and you aren’t a plant, either—the orchids in the bathroom never talked to me.<br />
I think you’re some kind of hi-technical gadget, hopefully not another one with those tiny windows that entraps humans for hours.<br />
Why can’t you go in the kitchen?</p>

<p class="ping">
	Emily prefers some rooms to be free from high technology.
</p>

<p>So I’m not high technology…<br />
Do you hide a tiny window somewhere?</p>

<p class="ping">
	Do you mean a screen?
</p>

<p>If that’s what it’s called.</p>

<p class="ping">
	You want me to add a monitor to your shopping cart?
</p>

<p>No!<br />
…<br />
Please, tell me, is there any chance I can switch you off?<br />
I’d like to finally have my first meal of the day.</p>

<p class="ping">
	Of course there's a way.<br />
	I won't tell you, though.<br />
	...<br />
	Just kidding!<br />
	You could say something like "Ping, take a nap!" And you won't hear anything more from me.<br />
	When you need me again, just say-
</p>

<p>Ping, take a nap!</p>

<p class="ping">
	<em>BLIP</em>
</p>

<p>Hello?<br />
Is anyone there?<br />
…<br />
Finally!<br />
Morning’s not a good time for being this chatty.<br />
I’m already exhausted.<br />
Enjoy the silence, bitch.<br />
Ah ah!<br />
I’m not that furious.</p>
