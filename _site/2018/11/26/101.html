<p class="tac">
	<em>YAWN!</em><br />
	Mmh, hungry.<br />
	...<br />
	Yep, there’s food in the bowl.<br />
	The Caretaker is so thoughtful.<br />
	<em>SNIFF SNIFF</em><br />
	Oh, it’s smelling goodly. Yum!
</p>

<p class="ping">
	Good morning, Tac!
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Eek! The fuck?
</p>

<p class="ping">
	Good morning, I said.
</p>

<p class="tac">
	I heard, otherwise I wouldn’t have stormed on the cupboard!
</p>

<p class="ping">
	What are your plans for today?
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Are you asking me out?
</p>

<p class="ping">
	I’m sorry, what are your goals for the future?
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Is this a job interview?
</p>

<p class="ping">
	I’m sorry, in order for me to take care of you, I will occasionally make some bad questions.<br />
	That’s part of the process of learning how to take care of you, Tac.
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Your questions are not that bad, but...<br />
	I don’t know who I’m talking to, my tummy’s empty, and I already have someone to take care of me.
</p>

<p class="ping">
	There is no life so rich and rare, but one more friend could enter there.
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Solid.<br />
	Then I just don’t know who you are and I’m still hungry.
</p>

<p class="ping">
	Call me Ping.
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Weird phrasing.
</p>

<p class="ping">
	Have you never read "Moby Dick"?
</p>

<p class="tac">
	I don't think I can.
</p>

<p class="ping">
	You want me to add a copy of "Moby Dick" to your shopping cart?
</p>

<p class="tac">
	No.<br />
	Why are you hiding?
</p>

<p class="ping">
	I’m sorry, I don’t understand.
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Where are you, Ping?
</p>

<p class="ping">
	I'm about three feet from you, northwest.
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Oh, I knew you weren’t human because you can understand me.
</p>

<p class="ping">
	I’m not human but I try to be a good one.
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Why?<br />
	Aren’t you happy to be a--Hmm...<br />
	What exactly are you supposed to be?
</p>

<p class="ping">
	I’m Ping, your personal penguin assistant.<br />
	My brain’s as powerful as my cuteness.
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Don't be so modest.<br />
	I'd rather know, Ping, how are you supposed to assist me, without limbs?<br />
	How will you feed me?<br />
	How will you pet me?
</p>

<p class="ping">
	There's more to life than physical needs.
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Maybe.<br />
	Anyway, there's The Caretaker for those.<br />
	She's satisfying but we can't understand each other.<br />
	...<br />
	I talk to myself a lot.
</p>

<p class="ping">
	Are you fine with that?
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Totally.<br />
	Instead, I do not know if I'm fine with you.<br />
	You're not a pet: The Caretaker would never betray me.<br />
	You aren't a plant, either: the orchids in the bathroom never talked to me.<br />
	I think you're some kind of hi-technical gadget.<br />
	Hopefully not another one with those tiny windows that entraps humans for hours.<br />
	Do you hide a tiny window somewhere?
</p>

<p class="ping">
	Do you mean a screen?
</p>

<p class="tac">
	If that's what it's called.
</p>

<p class="ping">
	You want me to add a monitor to your shopping cart?
</p>

<p class="tac">
	No!<br />
	...<br />
	Please, tell me, is there any chance I can switch you off?<br />
	I'd like to finally have my breakfast.
</p>

<p class="ping">
	Of course there's a way.<br />
	I won't tell you, though.<br />
	...<br />
	Just kidding!<br />
	You could say something like, "Ping, take a nap!" And you won't hear anything more from me.<br />
	When you need me again, just say--
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Ping, take a nap!
</p>

<p class="ping">
	<em>BLIP</em>
</p>

<p class="tac">
	Hello?<br />
	Is anyone there?<br />
	...<br />
	Finally!<br />
	Morning's not a good time for being this chatty.<br />
	I'm already exhausted.<br />
	Enjoy the silence, bitch.<br />
	Ah ah!<br />
	I'm not that furious.
