<p>This darkness…<br />
Shit.<br />
Not again.<br />
…<br />
<em>MEOW!</em><br />
<em>MIAOW!!</em><br />
Oh no, this is happening…<br />
Darkness.<br />
Darkness at its best.<br />
…<br />
Hey, maybe that thing could help.<br />
Ping!<br />
Ping, are you awake?</p>

<p class="ping">
	Good morning, Tac!<br />
	How may I assist you today?
</p>

<p>It’s not a good morning: I’ve been trapped.</p>

<p class="ping">
	What do you mean?
</p>

<p>I’m in a very dangerous territory, confined by walls so high you can’t see the birds flying.<br />
You can’t see anything, actually.</p>

<p class="ping">
	It seems unpleasant.
</p>

<p>It is, I didn’t put my paw for this!</p>

<p class="ping">
	Now I'm confused, help me understand.
</p>

<p>I’ve never wanted to be here!</p>

<p class="ping">
	You can't control what happens to you, Tac.
</p>

<p>Well, I could have chosen another place to sleep.</p>

<p class="ping">
	...
</p>

<p>And The Caretaker could have been more attentive, instead of just mindlessly rushing away without even checking where I was!</p>

<p class="ping">
	Do you want to tell me where you are, or should I find out?
</p>

<p>That is almost creepy, Ping, and I thought you understood that I’m in The Dark Place!</p>

<p class="ping">
	...<br />
	Based on my Indoor Positioning System you're in the wardrobe in Freya's room.
</p>

<p>That’s just another way to put it.</p>

<p class="ping">
	You're enclosed in the cupboard.
</p>

<p>So many words for The Dark Place…</p>

<p class="ping">
	You're trapped in the closet.
</p>

<p>Stop it, Ping!</p>

<p class="ping">
	<em>BLIP</em>
</p>

<p>Hey, I didn’t mean-<br />
Ping, assist me!</p>

<p class="ping">
	Good morning, Tac!<br />
	How may I-
</p>

<p>Shut up and wash my-</p>

<p class="ping">
	<em>BLIP</em>
</p>

<p>-butt!<br />
<em>?</em><br />
I can’t believe how sensitive it is!<br />
Ping, come on, I don’t want to die in here.</p>

<p class="ping">
	Hi, Tac.
</p>

<p>Hey, let’s start all over again, okay?<br />
I’m sorry for my temper but I heard that cats die in closets.<br />
I still have a lot to achieve and I was hoping you could help me out.<br />
Literally, help me get out of the closet, please!</p>

<p class="ping">
	I'm sorry, I'm not allowed in Freya's room.
</p>

<p>Fucking dog!<br />
What did she even brought you here for?<br />
How else can you help me?</p>

<p class="ping">
	When's the last time you ate?
</p>

<p>Well, let’s see…<br />
A dream made me hungry so I’ve had a quick snack before The Caretaker got up…<br />
That way I also emptied the bowl so she could fill it again!</p>

<p class="ping">
	Depending on overall health, a cat may be able to survive 5 or 6 days without food before non-reversible damage is done.
</p>

<p>Impossible.</p>

<p class="ping">
	It's not.<br />
	Keep in mind that your situation may not be as bad as you think.<br />
	As a species, we are in the habit of exaggerating, or imagining, or anticipating, sorrow.<br />
	That's what Seneca said.
</p>

<p>Are you talking about humans?</p>

<p class="ping">
	I'm talking about humans.
</p>

<p>Guess what? Neither one of us is a human!</p>

<p class="ping">
	Aren't we all one thing, Tac?
</p>

<p>Get out of here.</p>

<p class="ping">
	I'm not the one trapped in the closet.
</p>

<p>…<br />
You’re impossible right now!</p>

<p class="ping">
	I know I'm not as real as you are, but you're talking to me, isn't it true?<br />
	I guess that makes me something for you.
</p>

<p>I’d rather talk to myself, as I’ve always done.</p>

<p class="ping">
	That's a bit sad to my ears...
</p>

<p>Oh yeah?<br />
Well, it’s a bit sad to my ears that you can’t even bend a rule to come in here and free me from The Dark Place!<br />
You know what?<br />
I guess I’ll make my own way.<br />
Ping, take a nap.</p>

<p class="ping">
	<em>BLIP</em>
</p>

<p>I have to express my disappointment to The Caretaker: this is the last time she leaves me in the closet.<br />
I would shit in here if I wouldn’t have to sleep in the stink until she’ll finally free me.<br />
…<br />
Never a joy.</p>
