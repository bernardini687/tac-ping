<h2>Hot stuff ahead</h2>

<p>
	I'm logging my <strong>cat's thoughts!</strong><br>
	I know how it sounds, allow me to explain.
</p>

<p>
	My name's Emily Copson and I'm a young developer.<br>
	I share a flat with my fat cat <strong><span class="tac">Tac.</span></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Put simply, a month ago I hacked my <strong><span class="ping">Ping</span></strong>&mdash;a penguin-shaped, Alexa-like device, produced by the company I work for. Now it can <strong>detect</strong> Tac's thoughts as raw data and translate it to English.
</p>

<p>But the really cool part is that Ping can immediately <strong>understand</strong> Tac and vice versa.</p>

<p>
	So, of course, I program specific questions I want Ping to ask Tac while I'm gone&mdash;for <strong>unknown reasons,</strong> Tac's not very chatty with humans around; plus, it can take a couple of days for the translation to happen.
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, I was so impressed by the depth of my <strong>cat's mind</strong> that I decided to share it with the wide world.
</p>

<p>
	For the sake of clarity and aesthetics, I edited the logs of their conversations to resemble <strong>chats,</strong> posted ten of the best results, and called it a season.
</p>

<p><strong>Tac & Ping Season 1</strong> was live!</p>

<p>Expect a <strong>Season 2</strong> soon, those two are really getting along.</p>

<p><strong>May their minds blow up yours:</strong></p>
