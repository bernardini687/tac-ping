<p class="default">
	I'm logging my <strong>cat's thoughts</strong>!<br>
	That's dope.
</p>

<p class="default">
	I share a flat with my fat cat <strong><span class="tac">Tac</span></strong>. My name's Freya but apparently I'm just <strong>"The Caretaker"</strong> for that ungrateful furball.
</p>

<p class="default">
	Anyhow, somewhen around november 2018 I was hacking <strong><span class="ping">Ping</span></strong>, my penguin-shaped <strong>domestic robot</strong>, and realized it was detecting some unidentified data. Further investigations revealed I was dealing with Tac's thoughts.
</p class="default">

<p class="default">The really cool part is that Ping can immediately <strong>understand</strong> Tac and vice versa! What? Yeah. Deal with it.</p>

<p class="default">
	As much as I'd love to <strong>live chat</strong> with my cat, it looks like Ping's detection capability sucks when I'm around :(
</p>

<p class="default">
	Nevertheless, I was so impressed by my <strong>cat's worldview</strong> that I decided to share it with the world wide web.
</p>

<p class="default">
	For the sake of clarity and aesthetics, I edited the logs of their conversations in a <strong>dialogic</strong> form, posted a few of my favourites, and called it a season.
</p>

<p class="default"><a href="/logs/">Tac&Ping Season 1</a> was live!</p>

<p class="default">Expect a <strong>Season 2</strong> soon, those two are really getting along.</p>
