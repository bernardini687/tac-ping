# About

I'm logging my **cat's thoughts** into text!<br>
I know it sounds bizarre, allow me to explain.

My name's Emily and I'm a young developer.<br>
I share a flat with my fat cat <strong><span class="tac">Tac</span>.</strong>

A few months ago I hacked my <strong><span class="ping">Ping</span></strong>&mdash;a penguin-shaped, Alexa-like device, produced by the company I work for.<br>
Now my Ping can detect Tac's thoughts as raw data and translate it to English.

But the **really cool part** is that Ping can immediately understand Tac and vice versa.

So, of course, I program specific questions I want Ping to ask Tac while I'm gone&mdash;as I discovered, Tac tends to be more **thoughtful** when humans are nowhere to be seen; plus, it takes a **really long time** for the translation to happen.

Anyway, I was so impressed by the **depth** of my **cat's mind** that I decided to share them with the wide world.<br>
This is **[tacping.com](/)**'s reason of being.

For the sake of clarity and aesthetics, I edited the logs of their conversations to look like a chat, posted ten of the best logs, and called it a Season.

**<a href="/archive/">Tac & Ping Season 1</a>** was live!

Expect a **Season 2** soon, **Tac & Ping** are really getting along.
