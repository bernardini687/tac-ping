# About

I'm logging my **cat's thoughts** into text!<br>
I know it sounds bizarre, allow me to explain.

My name's Emily and I'm a young developer.<br>
I share a flat with my fat cat <strong class="tac">Tac</strong>.

A few months ago I hacked my <strong class="ping">Ping</strong>&mdash;a penguin-shaped, Alexa-like device produced by the company I work for.<br>
Now my <strong class="ping">Ping</strong> can detect <strong class="tac">Tac</strong>'s thoughts as raw data and translate it to English.

But the **really cool part** is that <strong class="ping">Ping</strong> can immediately understand <strong class="tac">Tac</strong> and vice versa.

So, of course, I program specific questions I want <strong class="ping">Ping</strong> to ask <strong class="tac">Tac</strong> while I'm gone&mdash;as I discovered, <strong class="tac">Tac</strong> tends to be more chatty when humans are nowhere to be seen; and it takes a really long time for the translation to happen.

I was so impressed by the **depth** of my **cat's mind** that I decided to share them with the wide world.<br>
This is **[tacping.com](/)**'s reason of being.

For the sake of clarity and aesthetics, I edited the logs of their conversations to look like a chat, posted ten of the best logs and called it a Season.<br>
**<a href="/archive/"><span class="tac">Tac</span> & <span class="ping">Ping</span> Season 1</a>** was born!

Expect a **Season 2** soon, **<span class="tac">Tac</span> & <span class="ping">Ping</span>** are really getting along.
