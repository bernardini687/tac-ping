# What the fuck?

I'm logging my **cat's thoughts**!<br>
I know how it sounds, allow me to explain.

My name's Emily Copson and I'm a young developer.<br>
I share a flat with my fat cat <strong><span class="tac">Tac</span></strong>.

Put simply, a month ago I hacked my <strong><span class="ping">Ping</span></strong>&mdash;a penguin-shaped, Alexa-like device, produced by the company I work for. Now it can detect Tac's thoughts as raw data and translate it to English.

But the **really cool part** is that Ping can immediately understand Tac and vice versa.

So, of course, I program specific questions I want Ping to ask Tac while I'm gone&mdash;for **unknown reasons**, Tac's not very chatty with humans around; plus, it can take a couple of days for the translation to happen.

Anyway, I was so impressed by the depth of my **cat's mind** that I decided to share it with the wide world.<br>
This is **[tacping.com](/)**'s reason of being.

For the sake of clarity and aesthetics, I edited the logs of their conversations to resemble chats, posted ten of the best results, and called it a season.

**<a href="/archive/">Tac & Ping Season 1</a>** was live!

Expect a **Season 2** soon, those two are really getting along.
